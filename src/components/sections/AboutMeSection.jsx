My name is <span className='clear-blue-color'>Naomi</span>, I'm 24 years old and I'm a software developer. I enjoy web development and design, but as a creative person I have other hobbies too. I consider myself a nerd, and I enjoy spending time searching tools and gadgets to <span className='clear-blue-color'>improve my work and organization</span> related and non-related to my studied field.</p>
                    <p className='main-white roboto-regular w-75 text-justify mx-auto fs-5'>
                        As a software developer I have experience with technologies like React, Laravel and Angular as a <span className='clear-blue-color'>fullstack developer</span>. I'm always open to learning new skills and eager to grow. Nevertheless, it's important to say that I'm not only a proficient developer, but also a great administrator and <span className='clear-blue-color'>team player</span> who can coordinate and do whatever it's needed. <br />
                        As a person, I'm a huge <span className='clear-blue-color'>fan of books</span> of any kind and music (mostly pop [Taylor Swift] and some rock here and there), I enjoy cooking, running, binge watching TV shows and <span className='clear-blue-color'>spending time</span> with my family, friends and more than anything, my pets.
